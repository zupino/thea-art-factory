# thea-art-factory

More details on `docs` branch, `master` contains for the moment only the bolier-plate 
code with the basic skelethon for Artwork and ArtFactory contracts.

Not completed but intended to be always compiling.

## Truffle settings

The project is initialized with truffle suite, and a local instance of ganache is expected 
to run on 127.0.0.1:7545 

`truffle-config.js` needs to have the `development` network explicitly mentioned,
otherwise the `truffle test` command will fail (see https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/1976)
