# thea-art-factory

Art selling fund for our daughter. Based on Simon de la Rouvier work TAIAOS (thisartworkisalwaysonsale.com).

## Description

Thea's drawing is digitilized as ERC721 token. Each art piece is assigned to a patron and a selling price defi
ned.
Anyone can buy the art piece from current owner at any time, by setting a deposit.
A percentage of the deposit is transferred to the artist.

## Installation

The Truffle environment is used for testing and deployment of the contract code, you can install using npm (NodeJS v8.9.4 or later)
```
npm install -g truffle

There is a dependency on Open Zeppelin ERC721 implementation, this contracts are not part of the repository an
d are supposed to be installed freshly from npm, to ensure latest version will be used.
